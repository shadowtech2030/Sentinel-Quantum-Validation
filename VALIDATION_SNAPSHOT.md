# Sentinel Quantum — Public Validation Snapshot

**Status:** Internal validation baseline  
**Public snapshot version:** 0.1.0  
**Organization:** Shadow-Tech2030 Inc.

## Result

**838 automated tests passed — 0 failed**

This figure refers to the current automated software-validation suite in the internal development environment.

## Areas covered

The suite exercises security behaviors across:

1. Cryptographic controls
2. Fail-closed policy behavior
3. Anti-replay protections
4. Post-quantum key establishment
5. Compromise-recovery mechanisms
6. Process hardening
7. Software-supply-chain controls
8. Authority and trust boundaries
9. Evidence integrity and auditability
10. Safe-local behavior when central services are unavailable

## Post-quantum operations

The current validation environment exercises:

- **ML-KEM-768** for post-quantum key establishment
- **ML-DSA-65** for post-quantum digital signatures
- OpenSSL-backed cryptographic operations

## Interpretation

The result supports this statement:

> The software contracts and security behaviors covered by the automated test suite are reproducible in the current validation environment.

It does **not** support these stronger claims:

- “Sentinel Quantum is unbreakable.”
- “All hardware-backed security has been validated.”
- “Side-channel resistance has been proven.”
- “Every possible attack path has been eliminated.”
- “The platform has received independent certification.”

## Next validation stages

Planned validation stages include:

- independent technical review;
- hardware-backed cryptographic validation;
- HSM / secure-element integration testing;
- physical and side-channel evaluation;
- integration validation with Sentinel Central and Sentinel Edge;
- third-party or academic reproducibility testing where appropriate.

## Public evidence policy

Only non-sensitive evidence is published. The private implementation, proprietary policies, detailed test logic, secrets and sensitive attack information remain outside this repository.
