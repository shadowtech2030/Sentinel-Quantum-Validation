# Sentinel Quantum — Block 25 Public Security Limits

The Block 25 result is intentionally narrow and evidence-based.

## Supported claim

Sentinel Quantum has completed its current internal Field Hardening / External Validation Readiness milestone.

## Not supported by this milestone

Block 25 does not claim:

- independent certification;
- external certification;
- production certification;
- physical HSM validation;
- TPM or secure-element validation;
- QKD hardware validation;
- side-channel resistance;
- physical tamper resistance;
- universal attack resistance;
- invulnerability.

## Architecture boundary

Sentinel Quantum remains a cryptographic trust engine.

It may enforce cryptographic guardrails such as:

- deny;
- revoke;
- rotate;
- re-authenticate;
- require attestation;
- preserve SAFE_LOCAL cryptographic restrictions.

It does not independently make industrial-process decisions such as:

- stopping a PLC;
- opening or closing a valve;
- changing process logic;
- changing industrial setpoints.

## Public publication boundary

The public repository should not contain:

- source code;
- raw internal logs;
- secrets;
- private keys;
- credentials;
- internal hostnames or local paths;
- customer or partner confidential information;
- exploitable internal test detail.
