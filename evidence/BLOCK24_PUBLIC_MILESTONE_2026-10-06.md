## Specialized campaigns

| Validation | Result |
|---|---:|
| Successive Crypto Transition Campaign | **24/24 PASS** |
| Central / Quantum / Edge E2E | **10/10 PASS** |
| E2E Failure Campaign | **14/14 PASS** |
| Secure Local Continuity | **VALIDATED** |
| Crypto Diversity Slots | **READY** |

## Publicly disclosed conclusions

The milestone demonstrates at a high level that the current architecture can:

- enforce cryptographic lifecycle states;
- preserve historical verification during controlled deprecation;
- deny new use of deprecated cryptographic paths;
- retire algorithms to a forbidden state;
- reject forbidden-algorithm resurrection;
- preserve hardware-custody requirements during SAFE_LOCAL;
- fail closed when required hardware trust becomes unavailable;
- prevent silent downgrade to software custody;
- detect lifecycle rollback / tamper conditions;
- support migration testing without requiring a hard-coded permanent algorithm.

## Limitations

The synthetic next-generation KEM slot is simulation-only.

This milestone does not claim a new cryptographic algorithm, physical HSM/TPM validation, QKD hardware validation, side-channel certification or independent third-party certification.
