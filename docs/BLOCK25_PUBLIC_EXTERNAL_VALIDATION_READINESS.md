# Sentinel Quantum — External Validation Readiness

Sentinel Quantum has completed the current internal readiness stage required before external software validation.

## Readiness criteria met

The Block 25 milestone confirms:

- critical validation campaigns can be replayed;
- repeated campaign results remain stable;
- the full regression suite remains green;
- public evidence can be generated without raw internal logs;
- security claims remain bounded by explicit validation limits.

## Current internal result

**Status: PASS**

**1291 automated tests passed**

Repeated campaigns:

- Successive Crypto Transition — PASS / PASS
- Central / Quantum / Edge E2E — PASS / PASS
- E2E Failure Campaign — PASS / PASS
- Secure Local Continuity — PASS / PASS

## Appropriate external validation targets

External validation can now focus on areas such as:

- independent reproduction of security behaviors;
- adversarial failure testing;
- fail-closed verification;
- rollback / tamper behavior;
- SAFE_LOCAL behavior;
- performance and latency;
- recovery behavior;
- observability;
- validation on target hardware.

## What external validation should not assume

The current milestone does not provide evidence of:

- physical HSM certification;
- TPM certification;
- secure-element certification;
- QKD hardware certification;
- side-channel resistance;
- physical tamper resistance.

Those require dedicated external testing.
