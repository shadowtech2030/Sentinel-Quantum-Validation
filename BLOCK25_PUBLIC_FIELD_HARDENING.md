# Sentinel Quantum — Block 25 Public Field Hardening

Block 25 is a **hardening and validation-readiness milestone**, not a new cryptographic-feature milestone.

## Objective

The objective is to verify that the current Sentinel Quantum security behaviors remain stable and repeatable before the engine is submitted to external review.

## Publicly reportable hardening controls

The Block 25 workflow includes high-level controls for:

- bounded command execution;
- execution timeouts;
- repeatable critical validation campaigns;
- full regression execution;
- sanitized result reporting;
- SHA-384 evidence digests for validation output;
- omission of raw logs from public reports;
- detection of an unclean Git working tree before validation;
- explicit PASS / FAIL status.

## Repeated campaign strategy

Four critical validation campaigns were replayed twice:

1. Successive Crypto Transition
2. Central / Quantum / Edge E2E
3. E2E Failure Campaign
4. Secure Local Continuity

All repeated runs returned **PASS**.

## Full regression

The complete internal automated regression suite returned:

**1291 passed**

## Public evidence policy

The public result includes only:

- campaign names;
- PASS / FAIL status;
- high-level validation scope;
- non-sensitive test counts;
- limitations.

Raw logs and proprietary implementation details remain private.

## External validation readiness

Block 25 prepares Sentinel Quantum for external software validation focused on:

- reproducibility;
- adversarial testing;
- fail-closed behavior;
- recovery behavior;
- performance measurement;
- independent confirmation of stated security boundaries.
