## Interpretation

Block 25 demonstrates that the current internal software-validation baseline remains stable when the critical campaigns are replayed.

It adds a readiness layer around the Block 24 cryptographic-survivability work by focusing on:

- reproducibility;
- regression stability;
- bounded execution;
- sanitized public evidence;
- external-validation preparation.

## What remains true from Block 24

The current public architecture continues to enforce:

- fail-closed behavior where cryptographic trust is required;
- no silent downgrade;
- SAFE_LOCAL continuity;
- controlled algorithm lifecycle transitions;
- cryptographic diversity;
- hardware-custody policy boundaries;
- separation between cryptographic trust and OT operational authority.

## Public readiness statement

The supported statement is:

> **Sentinel Quantum is ready for external software validation.**

This milestone does **not** mean that external validation has already occurred.

## Validation limits

This result is not:

- independent third-party certification;
- HSM certification;
- TPM certification;
- secure-element certification;
- QKD hardware certification;
- physical tamper-resistance certification;
- side-channel certification;
- formal proof that every possible attack path has been eliminated.

Those areas require dedicated external and/or target-hardware validation.
