# Sentinel Quantum — Block 25 Public Validation Index

**Shadow-Tech2030 Inc.**  
**Public validation add-on — no proprietary source code**

This package documents the completion of **Block 25 — Field Hardening / External Validation Readiness**.

It is designed to be added to the existing public repository without replacing the current `README.md`, `VALIDATION_SNAPSHOT.md`, `SECURITY_BOUNDARIES.md`, `EVIDENCE_POLICY.md`, `VERSION` or `SHA256SUMS`.

## Block 25 public milestone

**Status:** PASS  
**Full regression suite:** **1291 passed**  
**External validation readiness:** **READY**

### Repeated validation campaigns

Each critical validation campaign was replayed twice:

- Successive Crypto Transition Campaign — **PASS / PASS**
- Central / Quantum / Edge E2E Validation — **PASS / PASS**
- E2E Failure Campaign — **PASS / PASS**
- Secure Local Continuity — **PASS / PASS**

Additional controls:

- Git working tree clean — **PASS**
- Full pytest regression — **PASS**
- Total automated tests — **1291 passed**

## What Block 25 means

Block 25 does not introduce a new cryptographic primitive.

Its purpose is to demonstrate that the current Sentinel Quantum security behaviors remain reproducible under a hardened validation workflow before external review.

The milestone focuses on:

- repeatability;
- field-hardening readiness;
- regression stability;
- fail-closed behavior;
- SAFE_LOCAL continuity;
- public evidence sanitization;
- external-validation preparation.

## Public claim

The supported public statement is:

> **Sentinel Quantum has completed Block 25 and is ready for external software validation.**

This is **not** the same as saying that Sentinel Quantum has already been independently certified or externally validated.

## Confidentiality boundary

This package contains no:

- source code;
- private keys;
- passwords or tokens;
- internal source-tree paths;
- raw validation logs;
- confidential customer data;
- confidential partner data;
- detailed attack paths;
- proprietary policy logic.
